Originally from Toronto, ON ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I attended the University of Toronto where I majored in Biochemistry & Human Biology. I was involved in a number of campus organizations, namely as Chapter President of Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity in 2017 and as a senior analyst for the University of Toronto Engineering Finance Association. For some time I thought that I wanted to go into the medical field but  continually had a nagging draw to technology. I had been been building computers, playing videogames and tinkering with code my whole life, so it was a natural jump when I took technical project management internship working at an advertising technology company.

The rest is history and I'm now a seasoned technical program manager with 6+ years of cross-functional software development leadership and program management experience. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for streamlining program operations, as well as for driving innovation across diverse projects and programs, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career. During the height of COVID I relocated to Pittsburgh, PA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ to build a Technical PMO of 6 project managers from scratch.

I would describle my Program Management style as Lean, focused on understanding problems that need to be solved and then developing a minimum viable solutions. I'm a strong believer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a>. I incessantly try to understand what 20% of program and process management lead to 80% of positive outcomes. I'm a process management minimalist, asking "What is the minimum viable process to achieve our defined goal?". I'm enthusiastic to reduce or remove process burden where they are no longer viable. As a people manager I always try and act as a servant leader, focused on understanding a team members day-to-day trials in order to better mentor and serve them.

I'm currently pursuing new opportunities in Program and Project Management, please feel free to reach out to me directly on LinkedIn or via Email!
