Originally from Toronto, ON ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, I attended the University of Toronto, where I majored in Biochemistry and Human Biology. I was actively involved in several campus organizations, including serving as Chapter President of Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity in 2017 and as a senior analyst for the University of Toronto Engineering Finance Association. While I initially considered a career in the medical field, I was continually drawn to technology. Having built computers, played video games, and tinkered with code throughout my life, it was a natural progression when I took a technical project management internship at an advertising technology company.

The rest is history. I am now a seasoned technical program manager with over 6 years of experience in cross-functional software development leadership and program management. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for streamlining program operations and driving innovation across diverse projects and programs, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career. During the height of COVID, I relocated to Pittsburgh, PA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ to build a Technical PMO of six project managers from scratch.

I would describe my program management style as Lean, focused on understanding the problems that need to be solved and developing minimum viable solutions. I'm a strong believer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> and rigorously strive to identify the 20% of program and process management efforts that lead to 80% of positive outcomes. I'm a process management minimalist, always asking, "What is the minimum viable process to achieve our defined goal?". I am enthusiastic about reducing or removing process burdens where they are no longer viable. As a people manager, I aim to act as a servant leader, focused on understanding my team members' day-to-day challenges to better mentor and serve them.

I'm currently pursuing new opportunities in program and project management. Please feel free to reach out to me directly on LinkedIn or via email!
